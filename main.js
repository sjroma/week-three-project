// Get all the operator keys from document



// Add onclick event to all the keys and perform operations



// Now, just append the key values (btnValue) to the input string and finally use javascript's eval function to get the result
// If clear key is pressed, erase everything



// If eval key is pressed, calculate and display the result



// Replace all instances of x and รท with * and / respectively. This can be done easily using regex and the 'g' tag which will replace all instances of the matched character/substring



// Final thing left to do is checking the last character of the equation. If it's an operator or a decimal, remove it



// Basic functionality of the calculator is complete. But there are some problems like 
// 1. No two operators should be added consecutively.
// 2. The equation shouldn't start from an operator except minus
// 3. not more than 1 decimal should be there in a number
		
// We'll fix these issues using some simple checks
